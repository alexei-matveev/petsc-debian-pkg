Description: Static libraries, shared links, header files for PETSc
 PETSc is the "Portable Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation", a suite
 of data structures and routines for the scalable (parallel) solution of
 scientific applications modeled by partial differential equations.  It employs
 the MPI standard for all message-passing communication.  Several sample
 scientific applications, as well as various papers and talks, demonstrate the
 features of the PETSc libraries.

Package: petsc-dev
Architecture: all
Section: libdevel
Depends: libpetsc3.2-dev, ${misc:Depends}
Suggests: petsc-dbg
Description: Virtual package depending on latest PETSc development package
 This metapackage will always depend on the most recent version of petscX-dev
 (X=version), so if you install it then you will get upgrades automatically.
